      HUD Manager is designed to provide complete control over the game's HUD.
      There are two main parts to HUD Manager.

      Layout Editor allows you to precisely adjust elements of the UI. 
      You can adjust the position of UI elements numerically, as well as change other settings of the element
      such as visibility and scale.
      You can save your HUD layouts in named presets, independent of the game's built-in four slots, and swap to
      them at will with a chat command, or automatically with Swapper.

      Swapper allows your HUD to react to the game state, changing the layout when in-game conditions of your choosing are fulfilled.
      Swapper has a highly flexible configuration system that allows your HUD layout to respond to almost anything in the game.

  - name: Layout Editor
    description: >-
      The Layout Editor provides similar functions to the in-game "HUD Layout" menu option.
      However, the interface is designed for precision rather than speed.
      You may want to consider first designing the outline of your UI with the in-game "HUD Layout" menu option before improving upon it in Layout Editor.

      The top of the window allows you to choose a layout from your list of presets, as well as add and delete presets to your collection.
      Upon first run, you should see that your four HUD slots from the "HUD Layout" screen have been imported as presets. If you ever wish to re-import
      your layouts, you can use the "Import" button at the top of the window.
      There is also the "Parent" field, which can be empty. Setting a parent allows the layout to inherit all elements from another layout.

      The "Options" dropdown allows you to change how the Layout Editor itself works. The defaults should be fine for most uses.

      Below the Options you can find the elements in your layout. 
      A layout does not necessarily contain every HUD element,
      and any HUD element not in the preset will be completely ignored by HUD Manager when changing to that preset.
      You can add a new element to the preset with the button at the top of the HUD Elements tab.

      - name: HUD element
        description: >-
          Upon clicking on a HUD element, it will expand to show its properties. From here you can move the element by adjusting its X and Y,
          as well as changing any other settings.
          
          You can click the magnifying glass icon to show a gray window on top of the element in question.
          You can click and drag this box to move the element.
          However, the box is not accurate for most elements, so don't rely on it for precise positioning.

          You can also click the trash can icon to delete the element from the layout.
          Please note that this will not hide the element—it will only prevent HUD Manager from adjusting it when changing to the current layout.

          If your layout has a parent, you will see a column "Enabled" on the left.
          This allows you to adjust only certain parameters of the HUD element,
          as any property with this column unchecked will inherit the value from the parent layout, if the parent layout also has the element.
          In most cases, this should be on, but it is useful for things like adjusting the opacity of elements without moving them.
      
      - name: Window
        description: >-
          Windows refer to the menu windows shown in-game such as Inventory, Map, and Chat. They can be changed similarly to HUD elements.
          
          Note that unlike HUD elements, you must first have the window open in order to add it to your layout.

      - name: External Elements
        description: >-
          At the moment, the only External Element that can be configured is Browsingway overlays.
          The Browsingway plugin must be installed for this to do anything.

          You need to set the "Name" field manually to be the same as the name of the Browsingway overlay.

          The "Enabled" column on the left allows you to define whether to change that property, or leave it untouched.

  - name: Swapper
    description: >-
      The Swapper allows you to apply different HUD layouts based on the in-game state.
      Examples of such states include being a specific class/job, being mounted, or having your weapon drawn.

      First, you must choose your staging slot. This is the HUD slot that HUD Manager will write the HUD layouts to when
      a layout change is triggered. Whatever is in this slot will be overwritten, so make sure you've imported that slot's layout into the
      Layout Editor. Once you've chosen a staging slot, you must select it (via the HUD Layout option in the game's main menu) to see the swaps.

      The swapper's configuration is displayed as a table. The first column allows you to (optionally) specify a job,
      and the second allows you to choose a gameplay state. 
      When the specified job and state become active, the layout, chosen in the third column, will be applied. 
      You can edit, delete, and move your conditions with the buttons in the fourth column.
      Finally, if the swapper is enabled, the rightmost column shows a mark if that condition is met.

      You can think of the conditions as being checked from top to bottom. As soon as a satisfied condition is met, that layout is applied
      and nothing below that layout will be checked. In other words, the topmost active condition will be used.

    help:
      - name: Advanced mode
        description: >-
          Enabling advanced mode at the bottom of the screen will show the Layer column on the left. This can be turned on and off by editing the desired row.

          A row with Layer activated will allow the swapper to ignore the "topmost active condition" rule.
          Instead of using the Layered row's layout as the final layout, the conditions below will be checked.
          If any of those conditions are met, the Layered row's layout will be applied on top of the below condition's layout.

          An obvious usecase here is 
          to create a "DPS Meter" layout that only contains a Browsingway external element,
          named the same as your DPS meter inlay in Browsingway.
          The "Hidden" flag would be enabled and active.
          Your base layout would have the same external element set up, but with the Hidden flag enabled and inactive.
          Then, you would create a new condition in the Swapper with Layer enabled and with "In instance" as the condition,
          and "DPS Meter" as the layout. If you put that condition at the top of the list, any time you enter an instance,
          your DPS meter inlay will be shown on top of whatever other layout has been selected.

          If this is still confusing, sorry, I pretty much made this feature with only that usecase in mind.
          I'm sure you can find some other uses for it though.

      - name: Custom conditions
        description: >-
          Custom conditions allow you to set up more complex States to be matched by the swapper. There are four kinds of custom condition.

          "Toggle by command" allows you to change the value of this State with a console command.

          "Hold key" causes the State to be activated when a given key (combination) is held.

          "In zone" will only activate the State when you are in one of chosen list of locations.

          Finally, "Multiple conditions" allows you to combine the result of several conditions using logical operations.
          For example, you could have a "Non-PvP Instance" condition that specifies being in an instance, but NOT being in PvP.
          You can have as many conditions as you wan, and these conditions can even be other Custom Conditions.
